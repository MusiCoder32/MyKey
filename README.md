# MyKey
python 3.7

本人十分喜爱敲键盘的feel，为了让键盘用得更顺手，做了这个MyKey小工具，非常适合程序员。目前功能都太过基础了，快捷设置做不到用户自定义，只能在代码中手动修改，故将其上传到github，期待有兴趣的小伙伴，一起完善。
因为使用了pyHook3这个库，故需要安装swigwin和c++打包工具。
项目拷贝下来后，将swigwin解压，并将swig.exe添加到系统环境变量即可
c++打包工具可以参看该贴

I loves typing feel, in order to make the keyboard with a more comfortable, made this MyKey gadgets, very suitable for programmers. At present, the functions are too basic, and the shortcut Settings cannot be customized by users, so they can only be modified manually in the code. Therefore, it is uploaded to github for those who are interested to improve it together.
Since you are using the pyHook3 library, you need to install the swigwin and c++ packaging tools.
After you copy the project, extract swigwin and add swig.exe to the system environment variable
The c++ packaging tool is available in this post
If you don't want to generate mykey. exe yourself, and you happen to have CSDN integrals, you can download them from the CSDN link
